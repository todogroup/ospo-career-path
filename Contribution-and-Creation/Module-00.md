## 0.1 Maturity levels

Corporate adoption of open source software can typically be classified with a model of maturity levels. These levels describe how open source software is used in an increasingly effective fashion to drive value and address business needs. One of the distinguishing factors for the different maturity levels is how outbound open source is handled in an organization. The insight that influencing the open source ecosystem is mainly done by participation in and contributing to open source projects is seen as a critical factor.

A typical maturity model of corporate open source adoption looks like this (see for example [Haddad: Open Source Program Offices](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/open-source-program-offices-primer-organizational-roles-haddad)):

0. Denial - No or unconscious use of open source
1. Consumption - Passive use of open source software
2. Participation - Engagement with open source communities
3. Contribution - Pragmatic contributions to open source projects
4. Leadership - Strategic involvement with open source to drive business value

To advance from one level to another, certain initiatives and structural and organizational elements are required.

Going from consumption to participation, for example, will start with informal engagement and low-effort activities such as reporting bugs in upstream projects, which typically is driven by technical needs. On that level, decisions about open source contributions will normally be ad-hoc and be taken for individual cases only.

Establishing dedicated decision making processes and formalizing contribution policies will lead to the next level. A typical step on this level is to establish an Open Source Program Office to support open source engagement and maintain an open source strategy and processes.

On the leadership level, contribution processes are mature and scale. Corresponding tool chains are implemented. Own projects with the goal to create new open source communities are started if that's required and appropriate. This will typically come with leveraging open source foundations to enable cross-company collaboration to strategically use open source to accelerate creating business value.

A company may decide to not progress to levels which are based on more contributions, and it's of course possible to build mature processes to consume open source software without contributing. In most cases, there will be some pressure to contribute back, though. This can arise from practical technical needs (missing functionalities or required bug fixes are typical reasons for contributing to open source projects), from the expectation to take responsibility in the open source ecosystem, or from the desire to reap the full benefits of the open source model.

## 0.2 How companies manage open source: Open Source Program Offices

An increasing number of organizations realized the tasks of managing open source in an enterprise, and the complex relationships that are inherent to the open source ecosystem when they are advancing in their engagement in open source, required dedicated support. For this reason, many of them started Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs) - though perhaps under a different name, such as Open Source Technology Centers, Open Source Community Development Team etc. OSPOs are a designated place where open source is supported, nurtured, shared, explained, and grown inside an organization. With such an office in place, businesses can establish and execute on their open source strategies with clear terms and responsibilities, giving their leaders, developers, marketers, and other staff the processes and tools they need to make open source a success within their operations.

The TODO Group offers a [set of guides](https://todogroup.org/guides/) on how to get started with an OSPO. Companies that are new to this topic, might want to first take a look at [**How to create an open source program**](https://todogroup.org/guides/create-program/)

## 0.3 Motivation for Open Source Contribution

There is a broad spectrum of motivations for contributing to open source projects or starting new projects. Here, we can only list some examples.

### Build software faster and better

Consuming open source software typically increases the development speed and decreases development costs since one builds upon existing code and a working and tested functionality. One risk however is that required features or bug fixes are not provided by the community as quickly as needed. To mitigate that risk, it might make sense to build up the required skills and create these bug fixes and/or features yourself. Contributing them back to the upstream projects has important benefits:

* Integrating "own" features into upstream projects makes maintenance a lot easier
* Upstream versions can be directly used in own products and services
* More features are obtained in shorter period of time
* Higher quality is achieved in shorter period of time
* Support available from core experts

### Exercise strategic influence

In addition to the benefits of open source software wrt. development velocity and quality mentioned above, contributing to open source projects can also be important from a strategic point of view. In the open source world, reputation and the ability to influence is typically build up by engaging in the community and by contributing. Thus, contributions to open source projects can help to:

* Influence the direction of upstream open source projects
* Gain (co)copyright on open source software packages
* Access to the creativity of everyone interested in software

Companies sometimes have the tendency to use money to exert influence. With open source projects this is not the most effective method. The currency of influence is contributions, because open source projects are usually much more driven by the work of individuals than the decisions of committees. So contributions work much more directly and effectively than being a member in an organization or paying for support or other services.

Open source communities (particularly those run by the big open source foundations) provide a neutral place for collaboration between companies and other organizations. Thus, an open source approach could offer new ways of collaboration with suppliers, customers, partner and even competitors, just to mention industry- or domain-specific projects such as [Linux Foundation Energy](https://www.lfenergy.org/) or [Eclipse Tractus-X](https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/eclipse-tractus-x). Establishing open source communities can also be a powerful means to create and maintain ecosystems and to establish de facto standards.

### Attract, grow and retain talents

Software (and therefore also open source software) becomes more and more ubiquitous in many products and areas. Thus, for many companies it is crucial to have a skilled and motivated software development workforce. This is not only true for software or cloud companies, but also for companies from other segments, such as traditional hardware producers who integrate software into their products more and more, or any other company which is becoming more dependent on software due to accelerating digital transformation. An open source strategy including open source contributions and community engagements supports this:

* Increase developer satisfaction
* Improve quality and boosts developer skills by peer review of each contribution by core experts
* Make company visible as an attractive employer
* Improve company's reputation, and with it the standing of developers in their communities

### Be resilient and keep open source sustainable

Open source software development is living from its communities. As mentioned above, the usage (also called consumption) of open source software helps to decrease costs and speed up development, but that's only possible because there is a community behind these projects maintaining the software. 
To keep the open source development model sustainable, each consumer of open source software has therefore the responsibility to think about ways how to support these projects. These are some ways of engagement and support:

* Contributions in terms of code, documentation, time, security reviews, testing
* Donating infrastructure resources, e.g. compute resources for CI/CD and testing
* Dedicating a "DevRel" person to the project
* "Marketing support", for instance by featuring a project in company blogs etc.
* Monetary support (some important projects are maintained by developers who do this in their spare time and thus can only invest limited time in the project)
* Hosting hackathons and local community meet-ups

It is important to understand that though open source software has no license costs when consuming it, it is not available for free. To keep these projects attractive for its consumers, steady engagement and support is required. That's why it is important to have a strategy for open source contributions in place.
